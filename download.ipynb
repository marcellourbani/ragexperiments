At one end of the scale, one of the largest SAP customers in the world (a global Consumer Goods company) has performed its move to S/4HANA Core Finance and is in the process of performing its Supply Chain transformation using ActiveControl and at the other end of the scale, much smaller SAP customers have performed their migration from ECC to S/4HANA.\\xa0</p>\\n<p>Fundamentally, most of the core capabilities in AC that these customers have used as part of their S/4HANA migrations is the same. That said, there are some AC functionalities that are more relevant for larger customers with higher change volumes and more ECC custom Z code that needs to be remediated for S/4HANA, most notable the integration with 3rd Party product Smartshift.</p>\\n<p>\\xa0</p>\\n<p>The attached slidedeck summarise the various features and considerations that ActiveControl customers should certainly consider using as part of their S/4HANA migration or release upgrade.\\xa0 Further information is available on all of these features via the existing Basis Technologies documentation available at <a href=\"https://docs.basistechnologies.com/\">https://docs.basistechnologies.com/</a> or indeed as Knowledge Articles here on the Basis Technologies Support Portal.</p>\\n<p><br>Please review the attached slidedeck, and then reach out to your Basis Technologies Account Manager or Customer Success Manager if you would like a technical discussion to look at how ActiveControl can help you with your S/4HANA implementation, migration or release upgrade.</p>\\n<p>\\xa0</p>\\n<p>\\xa0</p>\\n<p>\\xa0</p>\\n<p>\\xa0</p>\\n<p>\\xa0</p>'},\n",

       "   'body': '<p>\\xa0</p>\\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><strong>Question:</strong></span></p>\\n<p>In the past we have been using SAP Solution Manager module \\'ChaRM\\'. And we were using the \\'Pre-Deployment Approval\\' there.\\xa0</p>\\n<p>\\'Pre-Deployment Approval\\' means that someone needs to approve a Change Request, before you can really start to work on it using SAP transports. In ChaRM you can only start creating transports once a \\'Request for Change\\' has been approved.</p>\\n<p>Is it possible to mimic this Pre-Deployment Approval process in ActiveControl?\\xa0</p>\\n<p>\\xa0</p>\\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>\\n<p>Yes it is possible to mimic the Pre-Deployment Approval in ActiveControl.</p>\\n<p>ActiveControl is using <strong>Business Tasks</strong>, which are more or less the same as the \\'Requests for Change\\' in ChaRM. And in ActiveControl you can configure that transports can only be assigned to <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">approved</span> Business Tasks.</p>\\n<p>Below the configuration needed is discussed in more detail, using an example process.</p>\\n<p>\\xa0</p>\\n<p>Important elements of the Pre-Deployment Approval process are:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Defining Business Tasks Planning Status values</li>\\n<li>Setting the initial Business Tasks Planning Status value</li>\\n<li>Workflow approval steps</li>\\n<li>Prevent that transports can be assigned to <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">non-approved</span> Business Tasks</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>In our example process used below we have configured the following:</p>\\n<p>1) The initial Business Task Planning Status will be \\'Validation\\'. <br>2) Approval is needed from 1) Line Managers and 2) Change Control Team. These people will receive an email, to notify them on the pending approval. <br>3) Post both approvals, the Business Task Planning Status will be \\'Approved\\'. Only then it will be possible to assign Transport Forms to this Business Task.</p>\\n<p>\\xa0</p>\\n<p><strong>1. Defining Business Tasks Planning Status values</strong></p>\\n<p>In this step we define the Planning Status values to be used. This needs to be configured in the Windows GUI, in the \\'Task Statuses\\' tab.</p>\\n<p>See below example. On the right side you find the Planning Statuses.</p>\\n<p><img src=\"https://support.basistechnologies.com/hc/article_attachments/11835084698653\"></p>\\n<p>\\xa0</p>\\n<p><strong>2. Setting the initial Business Tasks Planning Status value</strong></p>\\n<p>To be able to set the initial Business Task Planning Status value, we need to know the GUID for this value.</p>\\n<p>This can be found in the table /BTI/TE_TASKSTAT, in your ActiveControl domain controller. See below screenshot for an example.</p>\\n<p>The Planning Status values are shown below at the bottom of the screenshot, where the STATTYPE field (in 2<sup>nd</sup> column) is ‘PS’:</p>\\n<p><img src=\"https://support.basistechnologies.com/hc/article_attachments/360080246132\" alt=\"mceclip1.png\"></p>\\n<p>\\xa0</p>\\n<p>Let\\'s say our initial Planning Status value in the Business Task should be \\'Validation\\'.</p>\\n<p>In the table /BTI/TE_TASK_DEF we need to add this initial Planning Status value which a Business Task should get post creation. Per below screenshot, automatically the initial status ‘Validation’ will be set in Business Tasks.</p>\\n<p><img src=\"https://support.basistechnologies.com/hc/article_attachments/360080246432\" alt=\"mceclip2.png\" width=\"703\" height=\"150\"></p>\\n<p>\\xa0</p>\\n<p><strong>3. Workflow approval steps</strong></p>\\n<p>To get the Business Tasks approved, we can have 2 different situations:</p>\\n<p><strong>a) The approval needs to be done by a selected person.</strong> <br>In our example, these are the <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Line Managers</span>.\\xa0These people need to get the first notification email, to do the initial approval.</p>\\n<p><strong>b) The approval needs to be done by a person part of a specific team.</strong> <br>In our example this is the <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Change Control Team</span>.\\xa0These people need to get the next notification email, to do the final approval.</p>\\n<p>\\xa0</p>\\n<p><strong>a) Line Managers approval:</strong> in the Business Tasks one or more Line Managers need to be selected, and one of them could do the approval. The Line Managers are divided over Functional Teams.</p>\\n<p>We will set up <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Business Roles</span> for all teams, and assign people to these teams. User Roles need to be set up in the Windows GUI, in the \\'User Roles\\' tab. See below example, for the User Role \\'Healthcare\\'.</p>\\n<p><img src=\"https://support.basistechnologies.com/hc/article_attachments/11835100183837\"></p>\\n<p>\\xa0</p>\\n<p>When creating Business Tasks, a User Role needs to be assigned in the \\'User Assignments\\' tab. <br>See also below example.</p>\\n<p><img src=\"https://support.basistechnologies.com/hc/article_attachments/11835137853341\"></p>\\n<p>\\xa0</p>\\n<p>Post Business Task creation an email is sent to the Line Manager(s), to approve the Business Task.</p>\\n<p>To achieve this, in the Email notification program (/BTI/TE_RNOTIFICATION_ENGINE): put tick for ‘Task Roles Assigned’. Then an email will be sent to people in User Role assigned to the Business Task (Line Managers).</p>\\n<p><img src=\"https://support.basistechnologies.com/hc/article_attachments/360080467411\" alt=\"mceclip2.png\"></p>\\n<p>\\xa0</p>\\n<p><strong>b) Change Control Team approval:</strong> post Line Manager approval, a notification email needs to be sent to the Change Control Team.</p>\\n<p>The notification emails for Change Control Team (CCT) members is set up in 2 different tables.</p>\\n<p>First, the following email notifications are set up in the table /BTI/TE_NOTIF_CU:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Approval needed by CCT</li>\\n<li>Approval has been completed (to inform CCT that an approval has been done)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>See the first 2 lines in the below screenshot (first column, NOTIFID 2 and 3). Please notice the emails used (\\'NOTIF_HTML\\') and at which Business Task Planning Status the email should be sent (\\'PLAN_STAT\\').</p>\\n<p>Please notice that in the example screenshot below, we have also configured next notification emails for <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Business Task creators</span>:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Approval has been completed</li>\\n<li>Approval has been rejected</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>See the lines 3 and 4 in the below screenshot (first column NOTIFID 4 and 5).</p>\\n<p><img src=\"https://support.basistechnologies.com/hc/article_attachments/360080341612\" alt=\"mceclip4.png\"></p>\\n<p>\\xa0</p>\\n<p>Additionally, the Change Control Team members need to be maintained in table /BTI/TE_NOTIF_RE (for email notifications nr. 2 and 3):</p>\\n<p><img src=\"https://support.basistechnologies.com/hc/article_attachments/360080341732\" alt=\"mceclip5.png\"></p>\\n<p>\\xa0</p>\\n<p>\\xa0</p>\\n<p><strong>4. Prevent that transports can be assigned to <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">non-approved</span> Business Tasks</strong></p>\\n<p>Configuration Steps:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Switch on */BTI/TE_EXIT_SAMPLE_0930* in */BTI/TE_EXITC* table in the ActiveControl Domain Controller.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p><img src=\"https://support.basistechnologies.com/hc/article_attachments/360080342252\" alt=\"mceclip9.png\"></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Define the required Planning Status that must be reached on a Business Task before Transport Forms can be linked to it in */BTI/TE_MINPSTAT* table (also in the Domain Controller).</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p><img src=\"https://support.basistechnologies.com/hc/article_attachments/360080342192\" alt=\"mceclip8.png\"></p>\\n<p>\\xa0</p>\\n<p>The STATID value can be found in the table /BTI/TE_TASKSTAT, in your ActiveControl domain controller.

When using the <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red110\"><strong>MANUAL </strong></span>TOC trigger, the strong recommendation is that you create the TOCs via the Windows GUI or WebUI - and not directly via standard SAP.\\xa0 If you do the latter, then some of the ActiveControl functionality (including the automated removal of the TOC when the original transport is released and imported to QA) will not work.</p>\\n<p>\\xa0</p>\\n<p>5. Prior to ActiveControl 8.0, as part of most User Exit solutions developed for customers by Basis Technologies, TOCs were given a transport description equalling the Business Task subject. Some customers reported this as confusing in the scenario where multiple different source transports were linked to the same Business Task.</p>\\n<p>As such, as part of this new TOC capability, the following will now happen.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><em>If the user chooses to create TOCs at Transport level (per config in /BTI/TE_TOCONFIG) - then the transport description of the TOC will match the transport description of the original source Transport<br></em></li>\\n<li><em>If the user chooses to create TOCs at higher Task or Project level - then the transport description of the TOCs will remain as they were prior to ActiveControl 8.40, and be the subject of the Business Task.</em></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>\\xa0</p>\\n<p>6. Please note that this TOC capability is included only in the full ActiveControl Server transport. This means that to use it, you need to apply the server transport in your Development satellite systems. As such, this means that this capability cannot be used by customers using preNW7.01 systems where the full server transport is not applied.</p>\\n<p>\\xa0</p>\\n<p>7. Please note that even if using Manual TOCs, you need to add a row for each Path. (ie this is Key as part of the Config table.\\xa0 The benefit of this is that it means you can have difference TOC processes for each landscape (eg some you might want to auto-create the TF for the TOC, others you might not).</p>\\n</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<p>\\xa0</p>'},\n",

Moreover, since version 7.20, the popup should require no configuration and works out of the box.</span></p>\\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">As a result, some of the possible root-causes detailed below are not relevant for all versions of ActiveControl. If in doubt, please check with Basis Technologies team before assuming that all reasons are relevant for the version of the product that you are currently running.</span></p>\\n<p><br>This generally happens for one of the following reasons:<br><br>1) The /BTI/TE_CONTROL table is not configured correctly in your Development System.\\xa0 After go-live you should have one active entry with a blank username (and the RFC pointing at the Domain Controller). Any individual user entries should be removed - as they will conflict if not active.</p>\\n<p>2) The /BTI/TE_ACTIVE table is not configured correctly in the Domain Controller for your intended process (ie whether you want to get the popup when you release a transport or when you first add an object to a new transport)</p>\\n<p>3) The AC_RFC user you have set up in your Domain Controller is setup as a SYSTEM user; it needs to be a SERVICE user.</p>\\n<p>4) The AC_RFC user has not been setup against the client in which the user is saving/release transports.<br>Also make sure the RFC user has the correct roles assigned, and that the role profiles have been generated!</p>\\n<p>5) RFC Check: There is something wrong with the TRANSPORT EXPRESS CONTROLLER destination in the Development system or the TRANSPORT EXPRESS SID in the AC Domain Controller. Please also check the host name. In rare cases it can happen that the connection test is successful but the hostname is displayed incorrectly. AC uses this hostname detached from the RFC connection to establish the connection. This must therefore be displayed correctly.</p>\\n<p>6) This is a new system, which was previously used as an External system and it still has an entry in /BTI/TE_TARG_EXT in the DC. To remove this, delete the dummy target in AC.</p>\\n<p>7) The user that is saving/release transports does not have the correct access assigned to them in the Domain Controller (ie within SU01)</p>\\n<p>8) You are creating the transport with no target specified. If you do this, the transport is created as a local change request in SAP (and the popup is not triggered).</p>\\n<p>9) You are adding objects to a transport via SE01 / SE09 / SE10.\\xa0 This will never trigger the Transport Form.</p>\\n<p>10) TMS is not fully set up.</p>\\n<p>11) (pre-AC 7.0.2) Field exit has not been setup.</p>\\n<p>12) (pre-AC 7.0.2)\\xa0 You are using the aforementioned Field Exit, but profile parameter abap/fieldexit is set to false.</p>\\n<p>13) SAP system is at an older Basis version without BADIs and had remote transport applied. (if so, Basis Technologies can provide additional transport D00K901476)</p>\\n<p>14) (rarer root-cause) Kernel level on Development system different to that on the AC Domain Controller.</p>\\n<p>15) A N+1 target has been identified as your development systems parallel system, but the RFC or RFC password for that client is incorrect.</p>\\n<p>16) You are using onrelease Active Function, but for some reason the BADI is not activated. (it users standard BADI CTS_REQUEST_CHECK, the BTI implementation is called /BTI/TE_BADI_TR_FORM and should be activated by default). You can check this via SE19.</p>\\n<p>17) (AC 7.02 - AC7.20)\\xa0 You are using the oncreate Active Function, and are on a newer release of SAP where Field Exits are no longer used, but have not yet setup the implicit enhancement based solution.\\xa0 If this is the case, refer to seperate FAQ <a href=\"https://support.basistechnologies.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000362166-HOW-DO-I-setup-the-new-popup-implicit-enhancement-spot-version-\">https://basistechnologies.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000362166-HOW-DO-I-setup-the-new-popup-implicit-enhancement-spot-version-</a>.\\xa0 Please note that if you are on AC 7.20 or later, no setup should be required.</p>\\n<p>18) (rarer root-cause) No Language has been set in the TRANSPORT EXPRESS CONTROLLER RFC. Refer to seperate FAQ for details on the symptoms of this particular scenario:\\xa0 \\xa0<a href=\"https://support.basistechnologies.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016490232\">https://basistechnologies.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016490232#</a></p>\\n<p>19) (rarer root-cause) ONRELEASE works, but no TF on ONCREATE.\\xa0 At one customer - /BTI/TE_ENH_TRKORR_SAPLSTRD <span>enhancement implementation was showing as active, but actually it was not.\\xa0 Activating it again resulted in the popup working during ONCREATE.\\xa0 (BTI ref: #16377)</span></p>\\n<p><span>20) After a RFC issue it could be possible that there are some display issues in the AC Admin GUI and Transport Form popup does still not work. Please check Table /BTI/TE_RFC_ERR on your AC Domain Controller for errors on the failing development system. After that execute report /BTI/TE_RCHECK_RFC_CONNECTIONS on your AC Domain Controller for the failed SID of your development system.</span></p>\\n<p>\\xa0</p>\\n<p>Please double-check against what is specified in the AC Admin Guide and AC Quick Setup Guide for more detail about exactly what is required for each of the above.</p>\\n<p>\\xa0</p>\\n<p>\\xa0</p>\\n<p>\\xa0</p>\\n<p>\\xa0</p>'},\n",

The purpose of the ATC Analyser is to allow you to run the ATC check on a complete Transport or Business Task, saving time having to run ATC on each object in the Transport.</p>\\n<p>\\xa0</p>\\n<p>The purpose of standard SAP ATC itself, is to have a central SAP system to define a Code Inspector variant that can be used in any Development system to evaluate the local code, using the same standard central variant. With SAP standard ATC you have the option of running a Central code check (that evaluates all the objects within an ABAP Package, for example) or a Local ATC code check on 1 object that is viewed by a Developer.</p>\\n<p>\\xa0</p>\\n<p>Our ATC Analyser can replicate this standard functionality provided by SAP.</p>\\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">The Central check</span>, will connect to the Central ATC system, find the last Series Run (as specified in the Analyser configuration) and review all the results for the Series Run, to see if any of the objects in the Transport are highlighted.

Is that possible?</p>\\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><strong><br>Answer</strong></span></p>\\n<p>Normally you don\\'t want to use client 000 as a working client. It will only be used during SAP upgrades, or ABAP load generations (SGEN) etc..\\xa0</p>\\n<p>In very specific cases it could still be necessary to use client 000 a lot too. We had one customer who are using a product from one of their suppliers, for which they needed to import many transports into 000 clients.</p>\\n<p>ActiveControl does support managing transports in 000 clients, but only since <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><strong>ActiveControl release 9.1</strong></span>. Below you find more information on how 000 clients can be supported.</p>\\n<p>\\xa0</p>\\n<p><strong>Conditional import of transports into 000 clients (e.g. depending on a custom field value)</strong></p>\\n<p>At such, adding 000 clients in Path and Target settings already allows to use 000 clients.</p>\\n<p>In the Path settings, to capture transports in ActiveControl that got created in 000 client:\\xa0</p>\\n<p><img src=\"https://support.basistechnologies.com/hc/article_attachments/14110741798173\" width=\"427\" height=\"273\"></p>\\n<p>In the Target settings, to import transports into 000 clients via ActiveControl:\\xa0</p>\\n<p><img src=\"https://support.basistechnologies.com/hc/article_attachments/14110804531101\" width=\"370\" height=\"230\"></p>\\n<p>\\xa0</p>\\n<p>To make sure import into 000 clients will only be happening when a specific condition is met with, you can use the Import Consumer functionality.</p>\\n<p>For example, if only certain transports should be imported into client 000 depending on supplier instructions: you could add a custom field in the Transport Form, to show if the transport should be imported into client 000 or not.\\xa0</p>\\n<p>See the below FAQ for more details on this Import Consumer functionality:</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://support.basistechnologies.com/hc/en-us/articles/8422323230493-ActiveControl-Change-Note-TE-5302-Import-into-specific-client-s-based-on-custom-field-in-Transport-Form\">ActiveControl Change Note: (TE-5302) Import into specific client(s) based on custom field in Transport Form – Customer Support Desk (basistechnologies.com)</a></p>\\n<p>\\xa0</p>\\n<p>In case transports can always be imported into 000 clients, you don\\'t need to use this Import Consumer functionality.</p>\\n<p>\\xa0</p>\\n<p><strong>Enable to use client 000 as a Merge client</strong></p>\\n<p>By default, ActiveControl does not allow to use client 000 as a Merge client.

      "Around 20% of ActiveControl customers use Dev Transport of Copies as part of their process.\n",
      "This means that they do the Development, but leave the original transport unreleased in Development whilst they move a Transport of Copies (TOC) to QA system for testing. And they only release and deploy the original transport after successful testing of the TOC(s) in QA.\n",
      "ActiveControl has offered a Dev TOC capability as part of an AC workflow for many years - but the functionality has always had some limitations, which has frequently resulted in User Exits having to be created by the Basis Technologies Development Team to add capabilities like automatically creating the Transport Form for the TOC, assigning the TOC Transport Form to a particular [Type] or [Group] etc.\n",
      "To avoid the need for these custom User Exits going forward - ActiveControl 8.40 introduces a new configuration table /BTI/TE_VAUTOCON to make our customers (and the Basis Technologies Delivery consultants) more self-sufficient in implementing a Transport of Copies process at our customers.\n",

      " \n",
      "4. When using the MANUAL TOC trigger, the strong recommendation is that you create the TOCs via the Windows GUI or WebUI - and not directly via standard SAP.  If you do the latter, then some of the ActiveControl functionality (including the automated removal of the TOC when the original transport is released and imported to QA) will not work.\n",
      " \n",
      "5. Prior to ActiveControl 8.0, as part of most User Exit solutions developed for customers by Basis Technologies, TOCs were given a transport description equalling the Business Task subject. Some customers reported this as confusing in the scenario where multiple different source transports were linked to the same Business Task.\n",
      "As such, as part of this new TOC capability, the following will now happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the user chooses to create TOCs at Transport level (per config in /BTI/TE_TOCONFIG) - then the transport description of the TOC will match the transport description of the original source Transport\n",
      "If the user chooses to create TOCs at higher Task or Project level - then the transport description of the TOCs will remain as they were prior to ActiveControl 8.40, and be the subject of the Business Task.\n",

      "6. Please note that this TOC capability is included only in the full ActiveControl Server transport. This means that to use it, you need to apply the server transport in your Development satellite systems. As such, this means that this capability cannot be used by customers using preNW7.01 systems where the full server transport is not applied.\n",
      " \n",
      "7. Please note that even if using Manual TOCs, you need to add a row for each Path. (ie this is Key as part of the Config table.  The benefit of this is that it means you can have difference TOC processes for each landscape (eg some you might want to auto-create the TF for the TOC, others you might not).\n",
