      "Around 20% of ActiveControl customers use Dev Transport of Copies as part of their process.\n",
      "This means that they do the Development, but leave the original transport unreleased in Development whilst they move a Transport of Copies (TOC) to QA system for testing. And they only release and deploy the original transport after successful testing of the TOC(s) in QA.\n",
      "ActiveControl has offered a Dev TOC capability as part of an AC workflow for many years - but the functionality has always had some limitations, which has frequently resulted in User Exits having to be created by the Basis Technologies Development Team to add capabilities like automatically creating the Transport Form for the TOC, assigning the TOC Transport Form to a particular [Type] or [Group] etc.\n",
      "To avoid the need for these custom User Exits going forward - ActiveControl 8.40 introduces a new configuration table /BTI/TE_VAUTOCON to make our customers (and the Basis Technologies Delivery consultants) more self-sufficient in implementing a Transport of Copies process at our customers.\n",

      "1.   Existing /BTI/TE_TOCONFIG table is still required to be setup, to determinate some of the general global configuration and behaviour of TOCs within ActiveControl. More information on the configuration options for this table can be found in the ActiveControl Administration Guide, or seperate Knowledge Article here.\n",
      " \n",
      "2. New /BTI/TE_VAUTOCON table is then configured, depending on the Customers exact requirements for Dev TOCs as part of their overall ActiveControl workflow.\n",
      " \n",
      "3.  Existing Skipping functionlity within ActiveControl can then be optionally used to automatically get the Dev TOCs into the QA Import Queue (if approvals are not required)\n",

      "APPROVE:  used if you want to create the TOC when the Original Transport is approved in a (configurable) location (but prevented from Travel). Note that if you use this trigger option, the original TR cannot be approved directly - and always needs to be moved forward via approval of the TOC.

      " \n",
      "3. Automatically created TOC Transport Forms will always be assigned to the same Business Task as the original Transport.\n",
      " \n",
      "4. When using the MANUAL TOC trigger, the strong recommendation is that you create the TOCs via the Windows GUI or WebUI - and not directly via standard SAP.  If you do the latter, then some of the ActiveControl functionality (including the automated removal of the TOC when the original transport is released and imported to QA) will not work.\n",
      " \n",
      "5. Prior to ActiveControl 8.0, as part of most User Exit solutions developed for customers by Basis Technologies, TOCs were given a transport description equalling the Business Task subject. Some customers reported this as confusing in the scenario where multiple different source transports were linked to the same Business Task.\n",
      "As such, as part of this new TOC capability, the following will now happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the user chooses to create TOCs at Transport level (per config in /BTI/TE_TOCONFIG) - then the transport description of the TOC will match the transport description of the original source Transport\n",

      "\n",
      " \n",
      "6. Please note that this TOC capability is included only in the full ActiveControl Server transport. This means that to use it, you need to apply the server transport in your Development satellite systems. As such, this means that this capability cannot be used by customers using preNW7.01 systems where the full server transport is not applied.\n",
      " \n",
      "7. Please note that even if using Manual TOCs, you need to add a row for each Path. (ie this is Key as part of the Config table.  The benefit of this is that it means you can have difference TOC processes for each landscape (eg some you might want to auto-create the TF for the TOC, others you might not).\n",
