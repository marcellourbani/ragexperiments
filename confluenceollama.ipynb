(version 6.20 onwards, Windows GUI)\\nQuestion\\n: \\xa0\\nHow do I add an external transport into ActiveControl ?\\n\\xa0\\nAnswer\\n: \\xa0\\xa0\\nNew functionality since 6.20 simplifies the process for adding external third-party transports into ActiveControl , avoiding the historical steps that needed to be done in the\\xa0SAP\\xa0backend.\\nIt is now possible to upload the cofile and data file for the external transport into\\xa0SAP\\xa0from directly within the ActiveControl Windows\\xa0GUI, via new\\xa0\\nExternal Transport Request\\n\\xa0option on the [New Transport Form] screen.\\nThese files can be added either to the ActiveControl Domain Controller, or to a specific local development system.\\nAn ActiveControl Transport Form can then be populated for the transport, and moved through the workflow in the usual manner.\\n\\xa0\\nNotes\\nYou do NOT need to create\\xa0RFCs as ActiveControl will use existing\\xa0RFCs to get the transport files.\\nYou do NOT need to create Targets in the Windows GUI for each of the external system\\xa0SIDs. (these will get created automatically by ActiveControl)\\nSince you can only add a Transport to one path, you should use\\xa0TOCs if you need to get the same transport into multiple system paths in your landscape.\\nThe default behaviour of ActiveControl is that client dependent transports will stop in the Import Queue of the Development AC Target (if it has multiple clients configured), but a client independent transport will go straight to the first location after the Import Queue.\\xa0 Since you would typically always want External Transports to stop in the Dev Import Queue you could create a Skipping rule to force External Transports (ie with the TF [Type] = \"External Transports\" (or similar) to STOP in the Import Queue.\\nIn case your company is using a lot of external transports, and many external transports with the same SID (e.g. X01) need to go to different system tracks, then you would need to change the settings in the table /BTI/TE_TARG_EXT table a lot. In that table, an external transport SID is connected to a fixed Target and Path.\\nIn case you don\\'t want - or are not allowed - to make these changes in the table /BTI/TE_TARG_EXT table a lot, you might want to use the solution where you don\\'t need to change this table a lot anymore.\\nSee FAQ: \\nActiveControl Change Notes: TE-5398 : Enhanced External Transports - SID not linked to particular Target/Path - Customer Support Desk (basistechnologies.com)'),\n",

Some of the Client Independent transports are Imported into all available sap clients. Why?\\nHow Fast Import actually works is:\\n- if all transports are Client Inpedendent, only imports in one client\\n- if some are Client Dependent:\\n-- Client Independent transports which are listed before the first Client Dependent one get imported only in the 1st client\\n-- from the 1st Client Dependent transport, all other transports are imported in every client\\n\\xa0\\nAs a practical example:\\n=================\\nSuppose we have 10 transports named T1 ... T10, all client independent except T5 and T8.\\nI\\'m importing in clients 100 and 200.\\nA fast import method will import all transports in client 100 in one go.\\nAfter that, I need to import T5 and T8 in client 200.\\nIf T5 and T8 are purely client dependent, I could import only them. \\nBut suppose T5 contains a client independent object O1 too, which is also contained in T9.\\nImporting T5 and T8 only in client 200 I will end up with the wrong version of O1, coming from T5 rather than from T9\\nTo avoid this, we will import into client 200 transports T5 to T10\\nFor this reason, our fast imports behaves like this:\\n1) import every transport in the 1st client\\n2) import in subsequent targets only client dependent transports plus independent ones which follow at least one dependent one. \\n===============\\nfor more information see <a href=\"https://get.support.basistechnologies.com/servicedesk/customer/portal/6/article/2359987694\">Why is my Client Independent transport being imported into all clients in a Target?</a>'),\n",

Title\\xa0\\nImport into specific client(s) based on custom field in Transport Form\\nDetails\\nMany SAP customers have multiple clients within at least some of their SAP systems. In most cases, this multi-client strategys limited to the the Development system (eg 100 main client, 200 unit test client) - but in other cases, multiple clients can also be seen in Test and sometimes even Production SAP systems.\\nAt a handful of Basis Technologies\\' customers, there is a requirement to distribute certain changes created in certain Development clients to certain clients in Test and/or Production systems. This has been possible in ActiveControl for many years, via our client distribution capability introduced in 6.20 release.\\nDuring 2022, a new Basis Technologies\\' customer had a slightly different requirement, whereby they needed to distribute external vendor transports (ie not created in the customer\\'s own SAP systems) to certain clients of certain systems. Since this was not possible via the existing Client Distribution capability or indeed in general terms as part of Imports within ActiveControl, it has been developed as part of the ActiveControl 9.10 release, via a new Rules Engine consumer.\\nThis new capability allows customer to define rules - driven by a custom field on an individual Transport Form - that will determine what clients in a target system the transport should be deployed to.\\n\\xa0\\n3.
