(version 6.20 onwards, Windows GUI)\\nQuestion\\n: \\xa0\\nHow do I add an external transport into ActiveControl ?\\n\\xa0\\nAnswer\\n: \\xa0\\xa0\\nNew functionality since 6.20 simplifies the process for adding external third-party transports into ActiveControl , avoiding the historical steps that needed to be done in the\\xa0SAP\\xa0backend.\\nIt is now possible to upload the cofile and data file for the external transport into\\xa0SAP\\xa0from directly within the ActiveControl Windows\\xa0GUI, via new\\xa0\\nExternal Transport Request\\n\\xa0option on the [New Transport Form] screen.\\nThese files can be added either to the ActiveControl Domain Controller, or to a specific local development system.\\nAn ActiveControl Transport Form can then be populated for the transport, and moved through the workflow in the usual manner.\\n\\xa0\\nNotes\\nYou do NOT need to create\\xa0RFCs as ActiveControl will use existing\\xa0RFCs to get the transport files.\\nYou do NOT need to create Targets in the Windows GUI for each of the external system\\xa0SIDs. (these will get created automatically by ActiveControl)\\nSince you can only add a Transport to one path, you should use\\xa0TOCs if you need to get the same transport into multiple system paths in your landscape.\\nThe default behaviour of ActiveControl is that client dependent transports will stop in the Import Queue of the Development AC Target (if it has multiple clients configured), but a client independent transport will go straight to the first location after the Import Queue.\\xa0 Since you would typically always want External Transports to stop in the Dev Import Queue you could create a Skipping rule to force External Transports (ie with the TF [Type] = \"External Transports\" (or similar) to STOP in the Import Queue.\\nIn case your company is using a lot of external transports, and many external transports with the same SID (e.g. X01) need to go to different system tracks, then you would need to change the settings in the table /BTI/TE_TARG_EXT table a lot. In that table, an external transport SID is connected to a fixed Target and Path.\\nIn case you don\\'t want - or are not allowed - to make these changes in the table /BTI/TE_TARG_EXT table a lot, you might want to use the solution where you don\\'t need to change this table a lot anymore.\\nSee FAQ: \\nActiveControl Change Notes: TE-5398 : Enhanced External Transports - SID not linked to particular Target/Path - Customer Support Desk (basistechnologies.com)'),\n",
